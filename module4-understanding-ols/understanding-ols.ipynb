    "## What is Linear Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Linear Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) is a statistical model that seeks to describe the relationship between some y variable and one or more x variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img alt=\"Linear Regression\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Linear_regression.svg/1200px-Linear_regression.svg.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case, linear regression seeks to fit a straight line through a cloud of points. This line is referred to as the \"regression line\" or \"line of best fit.\" This line tries to summarize the relationship between our X and Y in a way that enables us to use the equation for that line to make predictions.\n",

    "#### Making Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Say that we were trying to create a model that captured the relationship between temperature outside and ice cream sales. In Machine Learning our goal is often different that of other flavors of Linear Regression Analysis, because we're trying to fit a model to this data with the intention of making **predictions** on new data (in the future) that we don't have yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are we trying to predict?\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we had measured ice cream sales and the temprature outside on 11 different days, at the end of our modeling **what would be the thing that we would want to predict? - Ice Cream Sales or Temperature?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We would probably want to be measuring temperature with the intention of using that to **forecast** ice cream sales. If we were able to successfully forecast ice cream sales from temperature, this might help us know beforehand how much ice cream to make or how many cones to buy or on which days to open our store, etc. Being able to make predictions accurately has a lot of business implications. This is why making accurate predictions is so valuable (And in large part is why data scientists are paid so well).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### y variable intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "We want the thing that we're trying to predict to serve as our **y** variable. This is why it's sometimes called the \"predicted variable.\" We call it the \"dependent\" variable because our prediction for how much ice cream we're going to sell \"depends\" on the temperature outside. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### x variable intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "All other variables that we use to predict our y variable (we're going to start off just using one) we call our **x** variables. These are called our \"independent\" variables because they don't *depend* on y, they \"explain\" y. Hence they are also referred to as our \"explanatory\" variables."

    "One final attribute of linear regressions that we're going to talk about today is a measure of goodness of fit known as $R^2$ or R-squared. $R^2$ is a statistical measure of how close the data are fitted to our regression line. A helpful interpretation for the $R^2$ is the percentage of the dependent variable that is explained by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the $R^2$ is the percentage of y that is explained by the x variables included in the model. For this reason the $R^2$ is also known as the \"coefficient of determination,\" because it explains how much of y is explained (or determined) by our x varaibles. We won't go into the calculation of $R^2$ today, just know that a higher $R^2$ percentage is nearly always better and indicates a model that fits the data more closely. "
